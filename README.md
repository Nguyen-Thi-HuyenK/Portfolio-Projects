# Portfolio-Projects

Hello there :wave:, thank you for stopping by! I am Huyen, I began my journey in Information Technology in August 2022 at OAMK, and it has been an interesting experience with substantial learning along the way. I have completed various small projects, both individually and collaboratively with my team, throughout my studies. In this repository, I have documented a collection of some of these projects.
## My skills:
- Front-end technologies: HTML, CSS, Javascript, TypeScript, React.
- Back-end technologies: Node.js, TypeScript, Express.js.
- Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL.

| Projects | Language   | 
| -----| ---------- |
|   Todo list  | TypeScript |
|   2  | Java       |
|   3  | Python     |

## I. Todo list

This is a simple application written by Typescript, HTML, CSS (with form control and list group class from Bootstrap), and Mysql as a database. This is my first individual task in my first year at OAMK. The application allows users to add To-do tasks to the list. After entering the task, it will be saved to the database. Users can delete the tasks by clicking on the trash bin icon, and the task will then be removed from the UI as well as from the database.
##### This is how the app looks like in the browser:

### Run the application

This application includes 2 separate repositories for frontend and backend code. First of all, you should clone both repositories to your local machine, then install all needed dependencies. For more details please refer to the original repositories via the links below:

## II. Calculator app
This is a simple calculator application built using React and TypeScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Note:** Tämän sovelluksen Readme-tiedosto on kirjoitettu suomeksi, mutta se on yksinkertainen ja helposti ymmärrettävä (The Readme file of this app is written in the Finnish language, however, it is simple and easy to understand).
##### This is how the app looks like in the browser (can be displayed as either dark or light mode):

## III. Fitness website - team project
- This Fitness website has been created as a project work for OAMK first-year Information Technology studies. The task was to implement a web app/site based on the chosen topic and to include certain functionalities such as registering, logging, editing data, and commenting. Implementation was to be done using TypeScript, NodeJS, Express, and PostgreSQL.

- The website includes fitness-related blog texts that users can read and comment on, a webshop to buy courses related to fitness and wellness, body mass index and calorie calculators, and short stories about successful user experiences. Our final website looks quite similar to the UI design we did at the beginning of the project.

**This is a group project where I worked with others. I was mainly in charge of several pages:**
- Courses and courses' detail: Partly design and build these pages
