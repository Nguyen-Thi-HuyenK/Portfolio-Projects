## üöÄ About Me
Hello there :wave:, thank you for stopping by! I am Huyen, I began my journey in Information Technology in August 2022 at OAMK, and it has been an interesting experience with substantial learning along the way. I have completed various small projects, both individually and collaboratively with my team, throughout my studies. In this repository, I have documented a collection of some of these projects.
## üõ† My skills:
- **Front-end technologies:** HTML, CSS, Javascript, TypeScript, React.
- **Back-end technologies:** Node.js, TypeScript, Express.js.
- **Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL.
- I also have some skills in using **Figma**, and **WordPress**

## Summary of my projects:

| Order | Project name    | Technologies                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |

| I | Fitness website | TypeScript, Node.js, PostgresQL |
| II | DeliveMe | React: Javascript/TypeScript, Node.js, Express, MySQL |
| III | GoEat | React native|


## I. Fitness website - team project
- This Fitness website has been created as a project work for OAMK first-year Information Technology studies. The task was to implement a web app/site based on the chosen topic and to include certain functionalities such as registering, logging, editing data, and commenting. Implementation was to be done using TypeScript, NodeJS, Express, and PostgreSQL.

- The website includes fitness-related blog texts that users can read and comment on, a webshop to buy courses related to fitness and wellness, body mass index and calorie calculators, and short stories about successful user experiences. Our final website looks quite similar to the UI design we did at the beginning of the project.

## II. DeliveMe - React application - Team project
- This is quite an advanced project in which we were asked to create a web-based automated parcel delivery system that includes 4 separate applications for different user roles. These are Consumer User App, Delivery Truck Driver App, Touchscreen App, and Parcel Generator ‚Äúrobot‚Äù App.

- Link for **Figma designs:**  [here.](https://www.figma.com/file/GCcswKBoM0Mw7A1t5ddLME/Parcel-Delivery-App?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=OQdyRkzDstrvgy5o-0)

**In this team project, I was mainly in charge of several views in the Consumer user app, writing test plans, and performing React tests and API tests:**
- Full-stack development of the features for sending a new parcel:

- Writing test plan, performing 2 React tests and 2 API tests of the consumer use app used react testing library.

- In this project, I had a chance to practice skills of teamwork in using the Kanban process model, Github version control, and different project management tools.

## III. GoEat - React native mobile application - International team project (Finland + Netherlands)
- This mobile app, developed using React Native, is compatible with both Android and iPhone. The frontend was designed by OAMK students, while our Dutch counterparts handled the backend. The app is user-friendly, offering customers a wide range of options to search and reserve restaurants based on location and various other criteria.
- Link for **Figma designs:**  [here.](https://www.figma.com/design/ijCo2hscx1MbkXyas4EfON/GoEat?node-id=0-1&t=zgOCqVPpfy88Hrw3-0)
  
**In this team project, my primary responsibilities included UI design and front-end development. I focused on the Home view, implementing features such as searching for restaurants by name, dish, categories, and subcategories/tags. I also developed the Restaurant view, displaying comprehensive restaurant information, and contributed to the functionality of the Register and Login views.**
- Below are some screenshots from my part for the app. For a complete overview, please refer to our demo video.
