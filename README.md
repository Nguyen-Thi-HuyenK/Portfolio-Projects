## 🚀 About Me
Hello there :wave:, thank you for stopping by! I am Huyen, I began my journey in Information Technology in August 2022 at OAMK, and it has been an interesting experience with substantial learning along the way. I have completed various small projects, both individually and collaboratively with my team, throughout my studies. In this repository, I have documented a collection of some of these projects.
## 🛠 My skills:
- **Front-end technologies:** HTML, CSS, Javascript, TypeScript, React.
- **Back-end technologies:** Node.js, TypeScript, Express.js.
- **Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL.
- I also have some skills in using **Figma**, and **WordPress**

## Summary of my projects:

| Order | Project name    | Technologies                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| I | Todo list | TypeScript, Node.js, MySQL |
| II | Calculator | TypeScript, Node.js, MySQL |
| III | Fitness website | TypeScript, Node.js, PostgresQL |
| IV | DeliveMe | React: TypeScript, Node.js, Express, MySQL |

## I. Todo list

This is a simple application written by TypeScript, HTML, CSS (with form control and list group class from Bootstrap), and MySQL as a database. This is my first individual task in my first year at OAMK. The application allows users to add To-do tasks to the list. After entering the task, it will be saved to the database. Users can delete the tasks by clicking on the trash bin icon, and the task will then be removed from the UI as well as from the database.
##### This is how the app looks like in the browser:
![Todo list](https://github.com/Nguyen-Thi-HuyenK/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/assets/todo-list.png)

### Run the application

This application includes 2 separate repositories for frontend and backend code. First of all, you should clone both repositories to your local machine, then install all needed dependencies. For more details please refer to the original repositories via the links below:

- ####  Link: [Frontend repository](https://github.com/Nguyen-Thi-HuyenK/Todos)

## II. Calculator app
This is a simple calculator application built using React and TypeScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Note:** Tämän sovelluksen Readme-tiedosto on kirjoitettu suomeksi, mutta se on yksinkertainen ja helposti ymmärrettävä (The Readme file of this app is written in the Finnish language, however, it is simple and easy to understand).
##### This is how the app looks like in the browser (can be displayed as either dark or light mode):

## III. Fitness website - team project
- This Fitness website has been created as a project work for OAMK first-year Information Technology studies. The task was to implement a web app/site based on the chosen topic and to include certain functionalities such as registering, logging, editing data, and commenting. Implementation was to be done using TypeScript, NodeJS, Express, and PostgreSQL.

- The website includes fitness-related blog texts that users can read and comment on, a webshop to buy courses related to fitness and wellness, body mass index and calorie calculators, and short stories about successful user experiences. Our final website looks quite similar to the UI design we did at the beginning of the project.

**This is a group project where I worked with others. I was mainly in charge of several pages:**
- Courses and courses' detail: Partly design and build these pages

## IV. DeliveMe - React application - Team project
- This is quite an advanced project in which we were asked to create a web-based automated parcel delivery system that includes 4 separate applications for different user roles. These are Consumer User App, Delivery Truck Driver App, Touchscreen App, and Parcel Generator “robot” App.

- Link for **Figma designs:**  [here.](https://www.figma.com/file/GCcswKBoM0Mw7A1t5ddLME/Parcel-Delivery-App?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=OQdyRkzDstrvgy5o-0)

**In this team project, I was mainly in charge of several views in the Consumer user app, writing test plans, and performing React tests and API tests:**
- Full-stack development of the features for sending a new parcel:

![Confirm and pincode](https://github.com/Nguyen-Thi-HuyenK/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/assets/DeliverMe/Confirm%20and%20pincode.png)
- Writing test plan, performing 2 React tests and 2 API tests of the consumer use app used react testing library.

- In this project, I had a chance to practice skills of teamwork in using the Kanban process model, Github version control, and different project management tools.

- For more details, please refer to the original project which contains 6 repositories:  [DeliverMe repositories](https://github.com/orgs/din22-awap-ParcelDeliveryApp-team1/repositories)
## V. GoEat - React native mobile application - International team project (Finland + Netherlands)
- This mobile app, developed using React Native, is compatible with both Android and iPhone. The frontend was designed by OAMK students, while our Dutch counterparts handled the backend. The app is user-friendly, offering customers a wide range of options to search and reserve restaurants based on location and various other criteria.
- Link for **Figma designs:**  [here.](https://www.figma.com/design/ijCo2hscx1MbkXyas4EfON/GoEat?node-id=0-1&t=zgOCqVPpfy88Hrw3-0) 
**In this team project, my primary responsibilities included UI design and front-end development. I focused on the Home view, implementing features such as searching for restaurants by name, dish, categories, and subcategories/tags. I also developed the Restaurant view, displaying comprehensive restaurant information, and contributed to the functionality of the Register and Login views.**
- Below are some screenshots from my part for the app. For a complete overview, please refer to our demo video.
