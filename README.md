# Portfolio-Projects

Hello there :wave:, thank you for stopping by! I am Huyen, I began my journey in Information Technology in August 2022 at OAMK, and it has been an interesting experience with substantial learning along the way. I have completed various small projects, both individually and collaboratively with my team, throughout my studies. In this repository, I have documented a collection of some of these projects.

| Projects | Language   | 
| -----| ---------- |
|   Todo list  | TypeScript |
|   2  | Java       |
|   3  | Python     |

## I. Todo list

This is a simple application written by Typescript, HTML, CSS (with form control and list group class from Bootstrap), and Mysql as a database. This is my first individual task in my first year at OAMK. The application allows users to add To-do tasks to the list. After entering the task, it will be saved to the database. Users can delete the tasks by clicking on the trash bin icon, and the task will then be removed from the UI as well as from the database.
##### This is how the app looks like in the browser:

### Run the application

This application includes 2 separate repositories for frontend and backend code. First of all, you should clone both repositories to your local machine, then install all needed dependencies. For more details please refer to the original repositories via the links below:

- ####  Link: [Frontend repository](https://github.com/Nguyen-Thi-HuyenK/Todos)

## II. Calculator app
This is a simple calculator application built using React and TypeScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Note:** Tämän sovelluksen Readme-tiedosto on kirjoitettu suomeksi, mutta se on yksinkertainen ja helposti ymmärrettävä (The Readme file of this app is written in the Finnish language, however, it is simple and easy to understand).
##### This is how the app looks like in the browser (can be displayed as either dark or light mode):
